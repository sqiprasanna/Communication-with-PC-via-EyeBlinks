# Communication with PC via Eyeblinks

A real time algorithm to detect eyeblinks in a video sequence from a standard camera is proposed. 
The proposed algorithm therefore estimates the landmark positions extracts a single scalar quantity ,eye aspect ratio categorizing the eye opening in each frame.
The system enables communication using blinks and interrupted as semiotic messages.
